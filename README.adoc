=== Running the app

This application is an adaptation of this blog: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-stream-kafka-avro-confluent

The application is adapted to using Spring Cloud Stream `3.0.2.RELEASE`.

The components are using the functional model by providing `Supplier` (producer) and `Consumer` (StreamListener) beans.

The application communicates with Confluent schema registry and uses avro serialization and deserialization.

Following are the instructions to run the app:

1. Start Kafka Broker and Confluent Schema Registry (Expecting them to be available on default hostname/port).
2. Run the application.
3. Run this command: `curl -X POST localhost:8080/employees/1001/Harry/Potter`
4. Watch the console of the application to ensure that the message is logged.
